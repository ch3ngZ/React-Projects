1. ALWAYS remember to add "key" function when listing things:
becuase it can help React sort things better
<details can be seen in Expense.js>


2. 
const [expenses, setExpenses] = useState(DUMMY_EXPENSES);

  const addExpenseHandler = expense => {
    setExpenses((preExpenses) => {
      return [expense, ...preExpenses]; <This is the better way>
    });

    <NOT THIS ONE>
    setExpenses([expense, ...expenses])

}


3. Math.max(...AnArray) => Make every element in the array listed out alone
